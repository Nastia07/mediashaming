            India is eager to take more Russian crude at bargain prices as buyers from the U.S. to Europe shun its oil after the invasion of Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russia’s Urals crude is being snapped up by Indian oil refiners after collapsing to a steep discount, even after Shell Plc was hit with heavy criticism following its purchase of the grade not long after the war started. Hindustan Petroleum Corp. recently bought 2 million barrels of the grade for delivery in June, and other processors are also seeking cargoes, according to people familiar with the matter.
          </p>

            India and Russia have a long-standing relationship that spans sectors such as defense and security, and oil purchases by Asia’s second-biggest importer adds to the Kremlin’s coffers as it tackles financial sanctions. India is considering workarounds including rupee payments benchmarked to the U.S. dollar for buying the crude, government officials said recently.

                Shell plc (Shell) today announced its intent to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in a phased manner, aligned with new government guidance. As an immediate first step, the company will stop all spot purchases of Russian crude oil. It will also shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia.
