            Commodities traders such as Trafigura and Vitol have helped keep Russia's oil flowing through its Baltic and Black Sea ports in March, when some Western firms started to snub the market, according to ship tracking, traders and shipping sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both Swiss-based trading houses have long-term deals with state-run Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to load crude under agreements struck before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of Western sanctions this month.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far in March, the two companies combined have loaded 22 cargoes of Urals crude, equivalent to 2.32 million tonnes of oil or 16.7 million barrels, according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data and sources. They shipped 1.84 million tonnes in February and 1.80 million in January.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bulk of the oil the two companies buy comes from Rosneft, though a large chunk of the crude Vitol handles via Russian ports comes from Kazakh producers.

                Galp deplores the Russian acts of aggression against the people of Ukraine. Galp’s Board of Directors has therefore decided to suspend all new purchases of petroleum products either sourced in Russia or from Russian companies. Although Galp has no joint ventures with any Russian entities, Galp is also in the process of eliminating direct or indirect exposure to petroleum products either sourced in Russia or from Russian companies in existing contracts. Although this measure will impact the Sines operations and its likely financial contribution, Galp will continue to ensure the supply of gas and fuels to the Portuguese market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Galp’s Chairman, Paula Amorim, underlines that “this terrible act of aggression by Russia against Ukraine absolutely violates the values that Galp defends, such as freedom and human rights. In such a complex and terrible context, our decision is simple: Galp will not contribute to finance war”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Galp’s CEO, Andy Brown, highlights: “Russia’s massive invasion of Ukraine represents a harsh blow to the free world. Our sympathy is with the Ukrainian people who are suffering this aggression. We are looking at how Galp can support the collective humanitarian efforts”.
