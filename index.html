          <h2>Russia destroys Ukrainian cities and kills innocent people</h2>
          <p>
            The Russian invasion of Ukraine started on February 24, 2022. Attacks by Russian forces were reported in
            major cities across Ukraine, including Berdyansk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, and the capital Kyiv.
          </p>
          <p>
            Western officials claimed that by scope, the war could be the largest in Europe since 1945. More information
            on the background of the conflict is available here. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
            Human Rights (OHCHR) verified 406 deaths of civilians in Ukraine during the war as of March 6. The Russian
            Defense Ministry stated that Ukrainian armed forces lost 827 tanks and other armored vehicles as of March 7,
            while the Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced a loss of 290 tanks by the Russian military as of March 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            The war resulted in a humanitarian crisis, as thousands of Ukrainians fled to the west of their country and
            abroad. Neighboring Poland recorded the highest number of refugees, at 672.5 thousand as of March 4,
            followed by Hungary, Moldova, and Slovakia.
