            The latest chapter in the history of the Burgas refinery dates back to its privatization in 1999 when the
            government approved the sale of 58 percent of the capital of Neftochim-Burgas. The bidder was LUKoil Petrol,
            a subsidiary of the Russian energy conglomerate, and the price paid was $101 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, LUKoil solidified its control over Burgas, buying up more shares, in particular those handed
            out to employees at the time of privatization. Today, the main shareholder in LUKoil Neftochim Burgas is
            Litasco with 89.97 percent and the LUKoil Oil Company with 9.88 percent. (The remaining 0.15 percent is
            owned by more than 7,700 individuals and legal entities.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Litasco is the key player in the transactions. It buys crude oil from Russia's LUKoil and then sells it to
            the Burgas refinery. Behind these three seemingly separate companies is LUKoil. Acting as the intermediary,
            Litasco seeks to buy low and sell high.
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference goes to Litasco, which is registered in Switzerland, where [corporate] profit/income tax is
            very low and there are legal options that allow this profit not to be taxed and go directly to Russia.

                Shell plc (Shell) today announced its intent to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in a phased manner, aligned with new government guidance. As an immediate first step, the company will stop all spot purchases of Russian crude oil. It will also shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia.
