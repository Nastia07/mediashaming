            <p>Food manufacturing company Nestlé made the decision to continue importing essential good to Russia, while pausing the import of non-essential good, such as Nespresso products.</p><br>
            <p>In a statement, the company said: “As a food company and employer, we also have a responsibility toward the people in Russia and our more than 7,000 employees – most of whom are locals.</p><br>
            <p>“We will continue to ensure a reliable supply of safe and essential food products to the local people in the country. Our diverse range of essential food products includes baby food and breakfast cereals. We have consistently stayed the course – also during difficult times – to serve the local people who need it the most.”</p><br>
            <p>The Ukrainian government has since called on Nestlé to suspend all operation in the country to put pressure on the Russian government.</p><br>
            <p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said: “[I] talked to Nestlé CEO Mr Mark Schneider about the side effect of staying in [the] Russian market. Unfortunately, he shows no understanding. Paying taxes to the budget of a terrorist country means killing defenceless children and mothers,” Mr Shmyhal said.</p>
