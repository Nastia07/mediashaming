            Trafigura Group is delivering Russian copper into London Metal Exchange warehouses, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that’s likely to stoke a heated debate about whether the bourse should be taking tougher action against Moscow.
          </p>
          <p>
            LME copper inventories rose by 10,850 tons, or 13%, in the past three days to a two-month high, with much of the increase coming in warehouses in Busan, South Korea and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Some of that metal is Russian copper that’s been delivered by Trafigura, said the people, asking not to be identified as the matter isn’t public.
          </p>
          <p>
            The LME declined to comment. A Trafigura spokesperson said: “We’re continuing to supply copper to our customers, which is a vital commodity needed for the energy transition.”

                Galp deplores the Russian acts of aggression against the people of Ukraine. Galp’s Board of Directors has therefore decided to suspend all new purchases of petroleum products either sourced in Russia or from Russian companies. Although Galp has no joint ventures with any Russian entities, Galp is also in the process of eliminating direct or indirect exposure to petroleum products either sourced in Russia or from Russian companies in existing contracts. Although this measure will impact the Sines operations and its likely financial contribution, Galp will continue to ensure the supply of gas and fuels to the Portuguese market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Galp’s Chairman, Paula Amorim, underlines that “this terrible act of aggression by Russia against Ukraine absolutely violates the values that Galp defends, such as freedom and human rights. In such a complex and terrible context, our decision is simple: Galp will not contribute to finance war”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Galp’s CEO, Andy Brown, highlights: “Russia’s massive invasion of Ukraine represents a harsh blow to the free world. Our sympathy is with the Ukrainian people who are suffering this aggression. We are looking at how Galp can support the collective humanitarian efforts”.
